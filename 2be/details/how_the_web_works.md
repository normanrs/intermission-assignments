## How The Web Works

### Background:

Review the materials below.

* First let's read [MDN HOW WEB WORKS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work)
* Next let's watch a few quick examples of [how the internet works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc).
* And [how IP addresses work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFooN7Mu0IM   - how IP addresses work).
* Finally let's tie these things together and watch a video about [DNS - what happens when you type an address into a web browser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72snZctFFtA).
* Lastly, let's read a little about [the anatomy of a URL](https://doepud.co.uk/blog/anatomy-of-a-url)

### Questions:
